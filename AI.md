# AI Tool Usage Log

This document records the use of AI tools during the development of this project. All core design, implementation, and decision-making were done manually. AI tools were used selectively to assist with reviewing, improving, and refining existing work when improvements were requested.

## AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**
- **GitHub Copilot**

## Role of AI in This Project/ How AI Tools Were Used

### Refactoring and Code Improvements
After writing the code, AI tools were consulted to:
- Review existing methods and suggest possible refactoring opportunities.
- Identify long methods and propose ways to split them into smaller, more focused helper methods.
- Suggest improvements to readability and structure without changing program behaviour.

### JavaDoc Review and Enhancement
AI was used to:
- Suggest clearer and more consistent JavaDoc wording for existing methods and classes.
- Help standardise documentation style across the project.

### Formatting and Style Suggestions
AI assisted in:
- Reviewing code formatting and layout.
- Suggesting stylistic improvements for readability.

### Test Case Coverage Checks
After test cases were written, AI was used to:
- Review whether existing test cases covered the required scenarios.
- Suggest additional test cases, including edge cases and boundary conditions.

### General Code Review Assistance
AI tools were occasionally used as a second opinion to:
- Check reasoning about logic and edge cases.
- Suggest possible alternative implementations for comparison.

## What Worked Well
- Provided a useful second pass review of code quality and structure.
- Helped identify overlooked edge cases in testing.
- Improved clarity and consistency of JavaDoc comments.
- Reduced time spent on repetitive refinement tasks.

## Limitations
- AI suggestions were sometimes too generic or did not fully account for project-specific constraints.
- Some recommendations required significant manual adjustment before being suitable.
- AI could not replace careful reasoning, testing, or design decisions.

## Overall Observations
AI tools served as a **supporting assistant** rather than a solution generator. They were most effective when used after implementation to review, refine, and improve code quality. The final design, correctness, and completeness of the project remained the responsibility of the developer.
